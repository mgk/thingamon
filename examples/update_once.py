"""Update the state of a thing once.

To use, follow the AWS IoT getting started guide and create a Thing.

  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-quickstart.html

You should have the following files:
  cert.pem - cert from AWS create-keys-and-certificate
  thing-private-key.pem - private key from AWS create-keys-and-certificate
  rootCA.pem - CA cert downloaded from URL in AWS IoT quickstart guide

Also take note of your specific AWS MQTT endpoint

Usage:

   update_once <AWS_ENDPOINT> <NAME_OF_THING> <MOOD>

For example:

   update_once B16HM459S4T9I0.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com foo happy

Then go into the AWS IoT console and see if your thing's state has been
updated.
